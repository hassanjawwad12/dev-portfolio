install it using `npm i motion clsx tailwind-merge`

alsi run `npm install tailwind-css animate`

Create a library folder and add a `util.ts` file (you will find this on the Acerternity website)
Copy the code for particular component u want to use from `Acerternity` and paste it inside a folder `ui` in the `components` folder.
You also have to add the particular component to the `tailwind.config.ts` file otherwise you won't see it
The `config code `will also be on the `Acerternity` website.

Simple things I learned making this Portfolio:
`left-full` means `left:100%`
